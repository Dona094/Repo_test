Script author- Anna Foix

The delete_files_from_manifest script was created for deleting files specified by file manifest provided by the user.

The script also lists out the files that will be deleted and the total number of files skipped in the process. Once this list has been confirmed for commencing the deletion process, the user should proceed to press enter to remove the files or press CTRL+C to cancel

Things to note

- The manifest file passed should be in .csv format
- The manifest provided by the user should have the URI (Uniform Resource identifier) column for the script to work
